Introduction to CSLD
**********************

CSLD, or compressive sensing lattice dynamics, is a comprehensive package to study lattice dynamics from first-principles. The interatomic force constants were fitted using the compressive sensing algorithm. Some of the attractive features of CSLD are 

- Accurate: up to 6th order anharmonic terms. Optimized treatment of long-range Coulomb interactions in polar semiconductors.

- Robust: fitting regularized with L1 penalty

- Efficient: using as few training structures as possible

- Versatility: phonon (harmonic) and anharmonic force constants, vibrational free energies,  interatomic potentials for solid molecular dynamics simulations.

CSLD is released as an open source package under the MIT license.

Tutorial
***************

More detailed documentation can be found in the `Manual`_ section next.
This section provides a short tutorial To get started quickly after installation. The files can be found in the examples/ directory.


CSLD requires an input structure file of very high accuracy. See the `Manual`_ section for details to prepare a VASP POSCAR-styled file first.


Si
====

Getting started
---------------

All input files have been prepared in the examples/Si/ folder.

- Phonon dispersion

::

   $ cp -r examples/Si examples/Si-test; cd examples/Si-test
   $ csld_main -f csld.in # or just csld_main

Then Check out the generated plots.pdf

- Third and fourth order anharmonicity with modified config file

::

  $ csld_main -f csld.in-anharmonic

The above can be equivalently achieved by modifying the command line rather than the config file

::

  $ csld_main --override "[fitting] solution_known=sol_2nd" \
  --override "[fitting] submodel1=anh 3 4" \
  --override "[fitting] solution_out=solution_all" \
  --override "[training] traindat1=fcc333/SPOSCAR fcc333/dir*0.06"

Input files preparation
---------------------------------
Now let's see how to start from scratch, by copying over the config file control.in and symmetrizing a primitive cell Si/POSCAR (pretending that Si/POSCAR was relaxed without proper symmetry)::

  $ cd ..; mkdir Si-test2; cp Si/csld.in Si-test2; cd Si-test2
  $ polaron_main --task primitive_no_standardize --prim ../Si/POSCAR --tol 0.001 >POSCAR

Next, prepare training data::

  $ mkdir fcc333; cd fcc333; echo -e "-3 3 3\n 3 -3 3\n 3 3 -3" > sc.txt
  $ polaron_main --task supercell --p1 sc.txt --prim ../POSCAR > SPOSCAR

where sc.txt is a 3x3 integer scaling matrix specifying the supercell. Perturbed supercells for phonon calculations can be generated in subdirectories by::

  $ polaron_main --task rand_disp_dir -R 0.01 --p1 SPOSCAR -N 1
  $ ls *
  SPOSCAR  sc.txt

  dir_00000-disp0.01:
  POSCAR

where the supercell fcc333/SPOSCAR was perturbed by R=0.01 angstrom randomly for N=1 time. For anharmonic terms, larger displacements should be attempted, e.g.::

 $ polaron_main --task rand_disp_dir -R 0.06 --p1 SPOSCAR -N 1

The user should then run DFT codes (e.g. VASP) to compute the corresponding total forces. Once done, the latter can be collected using the supplied **get-force.sh** script::

  $ get-force.sh -d dir_00*/



NaCl
====

This is an example that requires long-range forces

Getting started
--------------------

- Phonon calculation without long range forces. Note the absence of LO-TO splitting in the obtained plots.pdf

::

     $ cp -r examples/NaCl examples/NaCl-test; cd examples/NaCl-test
     $ csld_main --override '[phonon]nac=-1'

- With long range forces

::

     $ csld_main

Never mind the artifact in the phonon dispersion curve at zone center. It's the non-analytic correction.

- Third and fourth order anharmonicity trained on fcc333/dir_00000-disp0.06

::

  $ csld_main -f csld.in-anharmonic

- Export second and third-order force constants files (FORCE_CONSTANTS_2ND and FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD) for thermal conductivity calculations in `ShengBTE`_

::

  $ csld_main --override '[export_potential] export_shengbte=5 5 5 2 3' \
  --save_pot_step 1 --phonon -f csld.in-anharmonic

Input files for long-range forces
---------------------------------
To obtain the Born effective charges and dielectric tensor required for long-range treatment, dielectric calculations should be performed with density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) for the primitive cell before csld fitting. Obtain born_charge.txt and epsilon_inf.txt by


::

  $ polaron_main --task born --p1 PATH_TO_DFPT_CALCULATION/OUTCAR

Failure to use this script to generate symmetrized files may result in errors.

Executable scripts
==================

The main executable is the Python 3 script scripts/**csld_main**. Other executables include the scripts/**polaron_main** script for various auxilliary functions.
Help is available via::

$ csld_main -h
$ polaron_main -h


Input files
===========

The csld_main code takes two basic input files: **POSCAR** and **csld.in**.

- The structure of the primitive cell in VASP 5 format. The file name is specified in the config file (POSCAR, see above). It's important to keep high precision in the structure file. We STRONGLY recommend using the **polaron_main** helper script to symmetrize your primitive cell

::

  $ polaron_main --task primitive_no_standardize --prim your_input_POSCAR --tol 0.001 >POSCAR


- csld.in, the main configuration file containing essentially all the settings.

  - May be specified with the -f switch (see examples above)
  - The format is the usual configuration file with section headers and variable names under each section. Comment starts with "#". For example, the following specifies "POSCAR" as the primitive cell structure and 0.001 as the tolerance of symmetry finding (using spglib)::

     [structure]
     # primitive cell
     prim = POSCAR
     # symmetry finding tolerance, NOT used yet!
     sym_tol = 1E-3

  - The tag (e.g. "prim") is case insensitive. Our examples come with all lower case tags.
  - We recommend copying over one of the config files in the test/ example and adapting to your needs.
  - An alternative to editing csld.in is to change settings at the command line via the "--override [HEADER] TAG=VAL" option, where HEADER is a section in csld.in, and TAG and VAL are the desired entry under [HEADER]. This is equivalent to editing the corresponding entry in csld.in. For example, to change the primitive cell to PRIM

::

    $ csld_main --override "[structure] prim = PRIM"


- Additionally, for polar semiconductors, the Born effective charege and static dielectric tensors are required to describe the long-range interactions. Perform DFPT calculations and extract the required tensors into files born_charge.txt and epsilon_inf.txt by

::

  $ polaron_main --task born --p1 PATH_TO_DFPT_CALCULATION/OUTCAR

Training data
=============
    
Additional input files include the supercell structure(s), perturbed structures and associated total forces. 

Once the supercell size is determined, the main variable in the above setup is the number of structures (-N switch) to generate.

- For phonon calculations, determine the pair-interaction cutoff distance (say 8 angstrom) and estimate the number perturbations on supercell fcc333

::

  $ polaron_main --task nsc --prim POSCAR -R 8 --p1 fcc333/sc.txt

- For anharmonic calculations, start with a few supercell calculations with larger displacement, e.g. with the same number as phonon calculations, and incrementally add more calculations as needed. Note that the most significant anharmonic terms are typically short-ranged, so one might try smaller supercells than phonon calculations.

Program flow and settings
-------------------------

The csld_main script runs in the following steps, each controlled by a command-line argument of csld_main with detailed settings under a section of the csld.in config file. The most important settings are given below, too.

- Model setup, i.e. generating clusters, as well as identifying independent model parameters (implemented as computation of a symmetrization matrix *C*)

  - command line switch "--clus_step STEP". STEP=2 means generating clusters, **3** (default) =generate & save to file clusters.out.
  - command line switch "--symC_step STEP". 1=load file, 2=compute, **3** =compute & save to file Cmat.mtx
  - users usually should focus on the following settings rather than changing the command line switches unless they know what they are doing!

**********************
FAQ
**********************
This is a list of Frequently Asked Questions about CSLD.  Feel free to
suggest new entries!

How do I...
============

... select cutoffs for force constants?
   For anharmonic FCs, include at the very least the second NN shell for 3rd order and first NN shell for 4th order.

... decide the number of supercells needed?
   Once you made a choice on your model based on cutoffs, look for the final number of symmetrized FCs left. The number of supercell calculations should be at least N(symm)/3N(atom).

... use CSLD with another DFT code (Quantum ESPRESSO, etc)?
    Quite minimal: convert the structure to VASP5 format, and supply the computed forces to force.txt as a plain text table. It might be slightly trickier to figure out how to extract the dielectric constant or Born effective charge for semiconductors.

I got error message ...
========================

... "ERROR: to get corrections properly, please increase [model]dpcor_bond to approximately the cutoff distance of first neighbor shell"
    This means that you have a semiconductor system that needs dipole interaction corrections (see CSLD phonon paper PRB 2019). Set dpcor_bond under [model] as suggested.
